### Hey, I'm Ryan 🌴

I'm an undergrad comp-sci student at University of Maryland, College Park 🐢 
Just trying to learn and build whatever interests me at any given moment!
I post little personal projects here-and-there. Don't be afraid to pop in, offer advice,
or just scroll by.

Currently learning [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) by building a terminal-ui for twitter! It's memory-safety and it's type-system is pretty refreshing for a low-level language, so I'm enjoying it so far.
